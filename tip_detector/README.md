# STM Tip Identifier

Identifies if an STM tip is sharp or blunt based on a topographic scan from the STM. The model uses a convolutional neural network to classify individual dangling bonds as sharp or blunt. The code identifies the dangling bonds in the topographic scan and uses the trained model to classify them, allowing for an overall classification of the STM tip.
